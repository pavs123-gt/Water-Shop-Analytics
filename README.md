## Dataset Format

### CCTV Footage
The CCTV footage used in this project is a **single continuous video of approximately 2 hours**, captured during normal water shop operating hours and **provided directly by the shop manager**.

📹 **CCTV Video File:**  
👉 [Download CCTV Footage](./dataset/cctv_footage.mp4)

- Used for customer detection, face recognition, and visit tracking  
- Captured from a fixed camera inside the shop  
- Represents real customer activity

### Transaction Data
The transaction data is **not directly collected from a POS system**.  
Instead, it is **manually generated using a Python script** to simulate real shop transactions based on customer visits.

📄 **Sample Transaction File:**  
👉 [View sample_transactions.csv](./dataset/sample_transactions.csv)

### Transaction Data Generation
The sample transaction dataset is generated by running the following Python script:

```bash
python generate_sample_transaction.py
