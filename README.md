##  Project Overview
The **Water Shop Monitoring & Analytics System** automates customer tracking and operational analytics using computer vision and data analytics.

The system identifies customers using **facial recognition**, tracks visit frequency, links transactions, detects unpaid customers, and analyzes peak business hours.

---

##  Objectives
- Identify customers using CCTV footage and facial recognition  
- Assign unique customer IDs  
- Track visit frequency per customer  
- Analyze payment methods (Cash / UPI / Coins)  
- Track water can usage and sales  
- Detect unpaid and repeat defaulters  
- Identify peak and idle business hours  
- Generate automated reports  

---

## Features
- Face detection and recognition from CCTV videos  
- Customer visit tracking and repeat analysis  
- Transaction and payment mode analytics  
- Can size and quantity tracking (10L, 20L, etc.)  
- Unpaid customer identification  
- Staff optimization using traffic analysis  
- Automated shop opening and closing time detection  
- Dashboard-based visualization  

---

## Dataset Format

### CCTV Footage
The CCTV footage used in this project is a **single continuous video of approximately 2 hours**, captured during normal water shop operating hours and **provided directly by the shop manager**.

📹 **CCTV Video File:**  
👉 [Download CCTV Footage](./dataset/cctv_footage.mp4)

- Used for customer detection, face recognition, and visit tracking  
- Captured from a fixed camera inside the shop  
- Represents real customer activity  

---
### Transaction Data
The transaction data used in this project is stored in a CSV file generated manually using a Python script to simulate real water shop transactions.

📄 **Transaction Dataset:**  
👉 [View sample_transactions.csv](https://github.com/pavs123-gt/Water-Shop-Analytics/blob/main/sample_transactions.csv)

The `sample_transactions.csv` file contains **one row per customer transaction** and includes the following fields:

| Column Name        | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| transaction_id     | Unique ID for each transaction |
| timestamp          | Date and time of the transaction |
| customer_id        | Unique ID assigned to the customer |
| payment_mode       | Mode of payment (Cash / UPI / Coin) |
| can_size           | Size of water can (10L / 20L) |
| number_of_cans     | Number of cans purchased |
| amount             | Total transaction amount |
| payment_status     | Paid or Unpaid |

This dataset is used for:
- Payment mode analysis  
- Customer purchase behavior analysis  
- Unpaid and defaulter identification  
- Daily and monthly revenue analytics  

---

### Transaction Data Generation
The transaction dataset is generated by running the following Python script:

```bash
python general_sample_transaction.py
```

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the **Water Shop Monitoring & Analytics System**.
This section includes only environment setup and required libraries.

---

### 1️⃣ Create and Activate Conda Environment

```bash
conda create -n water_shop python=3.9 -y
conda activate water_shop
```

---

### 2️⃣ Install Core Data & Analytics Libraries

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

---

### 3️⃣ Install Visualization Libraries

```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn streamlit
```

---

### 4️⃣ Install Computer Vision & Face Recognition Libraries

```bash
pip install opencv-python face_recognition insightface onnxruntime
```

Note:
- `face_recognition` depends on **dlib** and may require CMake and a C++ compiler.
- `insightface` uses **ONNX Runtime**. CPU version (`onnxruntime`) is sufficient.
- Use `onnxruntime-gpu` if CUDA is available.

---

### 5️⃣ Install Backend / API Libraries

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

---

### 6️⃣ Install Database Libraries

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy
```

 (PostgreSQL):

```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

---

### 7️⃣ Verify Installation

```bash
python -c "import cv2, face_recognition, insightface, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, streamlit; print('Environment setup successful')"
```

---

###  Notes

- Recommended Python version: 3.8 – 3.10
- Conda is recommended for easier installation of OpenCV and dlib
- TensorFlow is optional and not required for the current implementation
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows
